List of Features
================

Transaction Support
	Each API request is wrapped in a transaction and rolls back any changes if an error occurs. For example, changes to an embedded resource may not be allowed. This raises a permissions error and any changes to the parent model instance will be reversed

Easy to Follow Code
	Conduit's flat and extendable design makes it incredibly easy to debug and tune for performance. The chain of events is meant to be explicit and atomic.

Permissions and Authorization Hooks
	:doc:`Pre-made hooks<access_authorization>` are available to filter or authorize resources based on whatever permissions you're using.

:doc:`Advanced Filtering & Ordering<filtering_ordering>`
	Prefilter your resources on the serverside or use url parameters that match Django Queryset syntax.

Intelligent Errors
	Conduit returns from validation and other errors of resources and their embedded resources so that you know exactly where errors are occuring.
